# Stop Light
Everyone knows, green means go, red means stop, and yellow means go faster!

## Objective
Create a stop light that illuminates green, yellow, or red when that respecitve button or color is clicked.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Optional:
- jQuery

## To-Do
- Create the shell for the stop light.
- Add buttons that when clicked changes illuminated light color. This means "shutting off" the previously lit color, and "turning on" the new one.
- **Bonus**
- Take the buttons away, and make the change happen on the click of the bulb.
- Make the stop light cycle using time intervals just a real one would. No click required, or start the cycle on the click of a button.
- Add effects that make the colors look more like actual lights illuminated.

Your stop light should look different from this one. Be creative, and use whatever colors, and styling you want. Maybe use different colors from the traditional stop light. Make a futuristic stop light, make a stop light you might see on an alien planet, or a stop light for fish. That's what so great about coding, the possibilities are nearly limitless!
